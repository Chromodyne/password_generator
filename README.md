## Randomized Password Generator ##

This application is a randomized password generator that takes a variety of parameters from the user and generates of password based on that criteria. 

It accepts a desired length ranging from 8 to 128 characters as well as parameters that determine whether the user wants upper case, lower case, numerical, or special characters included in the generated password. It can be easily modified to increase the available options or functionality.
